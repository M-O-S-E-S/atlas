ATLAS: Adaptable Tool Library for Advanced Simulation

This library provides many fundamental capabilities used in creating
virtual environment simulations.  It includes elements such as vectors,
matrices, quaternions, containers, communication schemes (UDP, TCP, DIS,
HLA, Bluetooth), and XML processing.  It also includes some extensions
to allow similar code to work in Linux and in Windows.  Note that support
for iOS and Android development is also included.
